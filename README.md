# Project idea
As big fan of football (soccer) and its statistics too, I decided to create Python script that counts player appearances in the Slovak 3. liga East (VÃ½chod) for 2023-24, because I did not find them among statistics for 3rd tier of Slovak football. The script can be applied for any league or season that come from the same website. 

# Output of the script
CSV file with all data that I wanted to have.

## Desktop application that I used for coding part
```
PyCharm
```

## Stuff that helped me to meet my desired results
```
Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis)
ChatGPT (gave me some useful hints)
```

## Build Setup, required to install dependencies for the project
pip install selenium
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install beautifulsoup4

## Used libraries and modules
```
import re
import time
import pandas
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
```
